        <h2>Project Addendum</h2>
        <p>This interactive "Haunted House Adventure" game was created as a web-based project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of event listeners, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic to create an interactive and engaging user experience. Below are key details about the design and functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Story Structure:</strong> The game progresses through various stages, each with its own set of choices that lead to different outcomes. The story is dynamically updated based on user input.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript Functionality:</strong> JavaScript is used to manage the flow of the game, including changing the text, updating images, and handling user input. Event listeners capture user clicks on buttons and trigger the next stage of the story.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS Design:</strong> The page is styled to create a simple and clean interface. A combination of margins, padding, and background colors is used to make the game visually appealing while ensuring clarity and usability. The responsive design adapts to different screen sizes for better accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> One of the challenges encountered during development was ensuring that the game's state (current stage) is preserved and updated correctly as the user progresses through different stages. Another challenge was managing the dynamic insertion of images based on the current story stage.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Future improvements could include adding sound effects, animations, and transitions between stages to make the experience more immersive. Additionally, more complex branching paths and a scoring system could be implemented to enhance gameplay.</li>
        </ul>
