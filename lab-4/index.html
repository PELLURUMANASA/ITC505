        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Modern education has seen a significant transformation due to digital technology, which has brought new approaches to teaching and learning. This essay explores the advantages and difficulties of using digital technology in the classroom as well as how it affects student performance.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The use of digital technology in the classroom has completely changed how we teach and learn in recent years. The traditional classroom has changed dramatically with the introduction of digital materials, educational applications, and online courses. This essay examines the use of digital technology in education and addresses its benefits, drawbacks, and long-term effects.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of Digital Technology</h2>
        <h3>Enhanced Learning Experience</h3>
        <p>The learning process has been enhanced by digital technologies including instructional games, online tests, and interactive whiteboards. These resources accommodate different learning requirements and styles while enhancing learning through interaction and engagement.</p>
        <h3>Access to Information</h3>
        <p>Students have unmatched access to a wide range of knowledge and resources thanks to the internet. Scholarly publications, instructional websites, and online libraries are easily accessible, facilitating in-depth study and research.</p>
        <h3>Flexible Learning</h3>
        <p>Students may learn at their own pace and on their own time thanks to e-learning platforms and online courses. Those who have other responsibilities and are working professionals will especially benefit from this flexibility.</p>
        <h2>Challenges of Digital Technology</h2>
        <h3>Digital Divide</h3>
        <p>The digital divide—the difference in access to digital technologies between various socioeconomic groups—remains a serious problem. Low-income students might not have access to the required technology or internet connectivity.</p>
        <h3>Distraction and Misuse</h3>
        <p>Digital gadget use can result in misuse and diversions. Games, social media, and other non-educational content can draw students' focus away from their academic work.</p>
        <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
        <p>Privacy and data security are issues that are brought up by using digital technology. Educational establishments are required to guarantee that the private data of their pupils is shielded from cyberattacks and unwanted access.</p>
        <h2>Case Studies</h2>
        <h3>Case Study 1: Online Learning Platforms</h3>
        <p>Because they make courses from prestigious universities available online, platforms such as Coursera and Khan Academy have revolutionized traditional education. A worldwide audience may now receive high-quality education thanks to these platforms.</p>
        <h3>Case Study 2: Educational Apps in Classrooms</h3>
        <p>Positive results in language acquisition and information retention have been observed in the classroom when educational applications like Quizlet and Duolingo are used. These applications offer individualized and interactive learning opportunities.</p>
        <h2>Future Implications</h2>
        <p>Technology is likely to play an increasingly important role in education as it develops. Augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence in education might improve learning results and experiences even further. To guarantee that every student benefits equally from digital technology, it is imperative to solve current issues.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Without a question, digital technology has had a significant influence on modern education, bringing both obstacles and many benefits. It is crucial that we strike a balance going ahead between the benefits of technology and methods to lessen its downsides. We can optimize the benefits of digital technology on education by tackling problems like the digital divide and guaranteeing data security.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> I chose 'Arial' for its clean and modern appearance, ensuring legibility and a professional look.</li>
            <li><strong>Heading Sizes:</strong> The heading sizes were adjusted to create a clear hierarchy: <code>h1</code> at 2.8em for the main title, <code>h2</code> at 2.2em for section titles, and <code>h3</code> at 1.8em for sub-sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Choices:</strong> A color scheme of blue and gray provides a calming effect while enhancing readability and navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin and Padding:</strong> Margins and padding were added to headings and paragraphs to improve readability and create visual separation between sections.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
        <p>I corrected any instances where headings were misused based on appearance rather than hierarchy, ensuring proper semantic structure.</p>
